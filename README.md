# glkit

This library implements a simple 3D viewer using OpenGL and ImGui for UI. It can be used to visualize 3D models and camera matrices,  which is useful for understanding how they work.

## Build and Run

To begin, go to the `third_party` directory and follow the instructions in the [third_party/README.md](third_party/README.md) file to download the necessary dependencies. After that, simply run `build.bat` on Windows or `build.sh` on Mac to build the project. Once the project is successfully built, you can run the demo.

## Demo

Use the `A`, `D`, `W`, `S`, `Q`, `E` keys to control the camera rotation around the center of the scene.
